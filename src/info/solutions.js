Through provision of reusable pads and capacity building on menstrual hygiene management and reproductive health for improved performance and self-esteem the girls will be able to attend all school days comfortably without fear. This will be done through distribution of reusable sanitary pads (have a life span of 12 monthsas well as ensuring provision of menstrual hygiene management education and facilities to girls in primary schools. By acquiring knowledge on menstrual hygiene management, the overall health status of the girls will be enhanced as myths and misconceptions that surround puberty and menstruation will also be demystified. The vision of distributing reusable pads is to ensure empowered vulnerable slum and rural girls and women in charge of their own socio-economic development. This project intends to promote distribution of reusable sanitary pads (that meet required quality and safety standards) to marginalised girls in selected poor and marginalised communities."
