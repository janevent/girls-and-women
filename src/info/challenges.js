let challenges = "The onset of menstruation, which is the most dramatic sign of girl's puberty, affects girl's socialization with family and community and may have a significant impact on their education. UNICEF estimates that one in ten menstruating girls skips school four to five days per month or completely drops out. A girl absent from school due to menstruation for four days of every 28 day cycle loses 13 learning days, the equivalent of two weeks of learning, and 104 hours of school every school term. Around 23% of adolescent girls in the age-group 12-18 drop out of school after they begin menstruating because of inadequate menstrual protection like sanitary napkins; those who remain in school are absent an average of four days a month. The subject of menstruation however is too often taboo, and has many negative cultural attitudes associated with it, including that menstruating women and girls are ‘contaminated, dirty and impure. Vulnerable girls in rural areas suffer stigma due to the following reasons;Inadequate preparations for young girls not yet experiencing menstruation, lack of or inadequate water to clean and wash body, lack of materials for managing menstrual hygiene, no private space and washrooms, inappropriate facilities for disposal of materials for those who use pads and physical and psychological pains during menstrual periods."
